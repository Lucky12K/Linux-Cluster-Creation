# Creating a Linux Cluster for simulations with OpenFoam

# What is a Cluster?

A cluster (or computing cluster) is a group of interconnected computers that work together in a coordinated manner as if they were a single system. Its main objective is to divide and execute tasks in parallel, allowing more complex problems to be solved, reducing processing time, and increasing system reliability compared to a single machine.

Each computer within the cluster, known as a node, contributes its own computing resources—such as processor, memory, and storage—and communicates with the other nodes through a network. Thanks to this architecture, clusters are widely used in scientific applications, data analysis, simulations, servers, and environments where high performance or high availability is required.

# What is OpenFOAM?

OpenFOAM is an open-source computational fluid dynamics (CFD) software used to simulate fluid flow, heat transfer, and related physical phenomena. It is widely used in scientific and engineering applications and is well suited for parallel execution on Linux clusters.

# What is OpenFOAM Used For?

OpenFOAM is used to simulate complex physical phenomena without the need to build real prototypes, saving time and costs.

Common applications include:

🌬️ Aerodynamics (cars, airplanes, drones).

❄️ Ventilation and air conditioning systems (HVAC).

🔥 Heat transfer.

🌊 Water flow and wave modeling.

🏭 Industrial processes.

⚙️ Turbines, pumps, and valves.

🧪 Scientific and academic research
