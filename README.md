# Creating a Linux Cluster for simulations with OpenFoam

What is a Cluster?

A cluster (or computing cluster) is a group of interconnected computers that work together in a coordinated manner as if they were a single system. Its main objective is to divide and execute tasks in parallel, allowing more complex problems to be solved, reducing processing time, and increasing system reliability compared to a single machine.

Each computer within the cluster, known as a node, contributes its own computing resources—such as processor, memory, and storage—and communicates with the other nodes through a network. Thanks to this architecture, clusters are widely used in scientific applications, data analysis, simulations, servers, and environments where high performance or high availability is required.
